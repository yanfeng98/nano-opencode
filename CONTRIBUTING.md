## Developing OpenCode

- Requirements: Bun 1.3+
- Install dependencies and start the dev server from the repo root:

  ```bash
  bun install
  bun dev
  ```

### Running against a different directory

By default, `bun dev` runs OpenCode in the `packages/opencode` directory. To run it against a different directory or repository:

```bash
bun dev <directory>
```

To run OpenCode in the root of the opencode repo itself:

```bash
bun dev .
```

### Building a "localcode"

To compile a standalone executable:

```bash
./packages/opencode/script/build.ts --single
```

Then run it with:

```bash
./packages/opencode/dist/opencode-<platform>/bin/opencode
```

Replace `<platform>` with your platform (e.g., `darwin-arm64`, `linux-x64`).

- Core pieces:
  - `packages/opencode`: OpenCode core business logic & server.
  - `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/`: The TUI code, written in SolidJS with [opentui](https://github.com/sst/opentui)
  - `packages/app`: The shared web UI components, written in SolidJS
  - `packages/desktop`: The native desktop app, built with Tauri (wraps `packages/app`)
  - `packages/plugin`: Source for `@opencode-ai/plugin`

### Understanding bun dev vs opencode

During development, `bun dev` is the local equivalent of the built `opencode` command. Both run the same CLI interface:

```bash
# Development (from project root)
bun dev --help           # Show all available commands
bun dev serve            # Start headless API server
bun dev web              # Start server + open web interface
bun dev <directory>      # Start TUI in specific directory

# Production
opencode --help          # Show all available commands
opencode serve           # Start headless API server
opencode web             # Start server + open web interface
opencode <directory>     # Start TUI in specific directory
```

### Running the API Server

To start the OpenCode headless API server:

```bash
bun dev serve
```

This starts the headless server on port 4096 by default. You can specify a different port:

```bash
bun dev serve --port 8080
```

### Running the Web App

To test UI changes during development:

1. **First, start the OpenCode server** (see [Running the API Server](#running-the-api-server) section above)
2. **Then run the web app:**

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/app dev
```

This starts a local dev server at http://localhost:5173 (or similar port shown in output). Most UI changes can be tested here, but the server must be running for full functionality.

### Running the Desktop App

The desktop app is a native Tauri application that wraps the web UI.

To run the native desktop app:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/desktop tauri dev
```

This starts the web dev server on http://localhost:1420 and opens the native window.

If you only want the web dev server (no native shell):

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/desktop dev
```

To create a production `dist/` and build the native app bundle:

```bash
bun run --cwd packages/desktop tauri build
```

This runs `bun run --cwd packages/desktop build` automatically via Tauri’s `beforeBuildCommand`.

> [!NOTE]
> Running the desktop app requires additional Tauri dependencies (Rust toolchain, platform-specific libraries). See the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for setup instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you make changes to the API or SDK (e.g. `packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts`), run `./script/generate.ts` to regenerate the SDK and related files.

### Setting up a Debugger

Bun debugging is currently rough around the edges. We hope this guide helps you get set up and avoid some pain points.

The most reliable way to debug OpenCode is to run it manually in a terminal via `bun run --inspect=<url> dev ...` and attach
your debugger via that URL. Other methods can result in breakpoints being mapped incorrectly, at least in VSCode (YMMV).

Caveats:

- If you want to run the OpenCode TUI and have breakpoints triggered in the server code, you might need to run `bun dev spawn` instead of
  the usual `bun dev`. This is because `bun dev` runs the server in a worker thread and breakpoints might not work there.
- If `spawn` does not work for you, you can debug the server separately:
  - Debug server: `bun run --inspect=ws://localhost:6499/ --cwd packages/opencode ./src/index.ts serve --port 4096`,
    then attach TUI with `opencode attach http://localhost:4096`
  - Debug TUI: `bun run --inspect=ws://localhost:6499/ --cwd packages/opencode --conditions=browser ./src/index.ts`

Other tips and tricks:

- You might want to use `--inspect-wait` or `--inspect-brk` instead of `--inspect`, depending on your workflow
- Specifying `--inspect=ws://localhost:6499/` on every invocation can be tiresome, you may want to `export BUN_OPTIONS=--inspect=ws://localhost:6499/` instead

#### VSCode Setup

If you use VSCode, you can use our example configurations [.vscode/settings.example.json](.vscode/settings.example.json) and [.vscode/launch.example.json](.vscode/launch.example.json).

Some debug methods that can be problematic:

- Debug configurations with `"request": "launch"` can have breakpoints incorrectly mapped and thus unusable
- The same problem arises when running OpenCode in the VSCode `JavaScript Debug Terminal`

With that said, you may want to try these methods, as they might work for you.
